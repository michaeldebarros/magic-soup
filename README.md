### Magic Soup

This repo started [here](https://github.com/michaeldebarros/go-routing), in a simple attempt to implement routing in Go.  I used Julien Schmidt's [Httprouter](https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter) for routing.

After that, I decided to build a simple CRUD app and in the process transfer some Node.js skills into Go. So I added Mongo DB, validation, sessions, middleware, etc.
